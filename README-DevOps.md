## Creating Dockerfile (Multi-stage build)

The Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image. The Docker image contains the Go web application and its dependencies. The Docker image is then used to create a Docker container.

We will use a Multi-stage build to create the Docker image. The Multi-stage build is a feature of Docker that allows you to use multiple build stages in a single Dockerfile. This will reduce the size of the final Docker image and also secure the image by removing unnecessary files and packages.

## Containerization

Containerization is the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a container. The container is then run on a container platform such as Docker. Containerization allows you to run the application in a consistent environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

We will use Docker to containerize the Go web application. Docker is a container platform that allows you to build, ship, and run containers.

Commands to build the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t <your-docker-username>/go-web-app .
```

Command to run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 <your-docker-username>/go-web-app
```

Command to push the Docker container to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push <your-docker-username>/go-web-app
```
